Cosmonium is a 3D astronomy and space exploration program. With Cosmonium you can navigate in our solar system and discover all the planets and their moons. You can also visit the neighboring stars and discover the true size of our galaxy and the Universe.

Cosmonium also supports (or will support) the creation of fictional planets and stellar system using procedural generation.

Cosmonium also already supports some Celestia addons (though CMOD and CelX are not yet supported).

### Requirements

Cosmonium runs on Windows, Linux or MacOS machine with a graphic card supporting OpenGL 2.1 or better (OpenGL 4.5 is recommended), 2GB of memory and at least 512MB of disk (up to 4GB if the HD and UHD textures are installed).

### Installation 

Download the package for your platform from the [Download](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Download) page and extract the package archive file, or look at the  [Installation](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Installation) page to install from sources.

The package contains only low resolution textures, see the [Installation](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Installation) page to install extra HD and UHD textures.

### Screenshots

### User interface

Cosmonium user interface is heavily based on Celestia, most of the command and keyboard shortcuts work the same.

### Full documentation

Cosmonium is still in its infancy, but it is already usable to explore all the planets and the moons of our solar system, all the neighbor or visible stars and much more. It also support custom content and addons, either as Cosmonium or Celestia addons.

The full documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki)
